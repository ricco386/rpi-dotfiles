# caption -- Provides a status line for each split.
# always -- "always" gives a status line in non split mode.
# %{=b} -- make it bright so that I have a clear list of items
# %?%F%:%45=%n*%f %t%? -- If current window does not have focus
# -- (this is a split) so we move to 45% of the screen and put,
# -- this split's selected window's title and flags.

# From here on is a hack until a "%-F" for no focus is provided.
# essentially, you can only select non-focused windows with "%?%F%:non-focused code%?"
# What is being added in the future will allow windows with "%?%-F%:focused code%?"
# If this doesn't make sense, don't worry, but it has to be done that way with variable
# expansion rules as they are.
# %?%F%{r}%:%{s kk}%? -- If current window has focus, make text red, else (%:)
# -- make the text standout (normal colors) and black on black.
# -- net effect by this is that the focused window shows my status bar
# -- unfocused windows show only their selected window's title.
# %H -- Provide the hostname,
# %?%F%{-}%? -- If this window has focus, pop off the last color on the color stack (i.e. red)
# %L= -- Set truncation marker to this location, permits the spiffy elipses
# %-Lw -- Provide the window list before the current window
# %45> -- Not really sure, but I think it sets the current window to the 45% mark
# %?%F%{g} -- If current window has focus, set color green, unfocused windows have standout with black on black (color stack)
# %?%n*%f %t -- Window number * flags title
# %?%F%{-}%? -- If this window has focus, pop off the last color on the color stack (i.e. green)
# %+Lw -- Provide the window list following the current window
# %-17= -- Go 17 characters from the right of screen towards left
# %?%F%{y} -- If current window has focus, set color yellow, unfocused windows have standout with black on black (color stack)
# %?%c %Y-%m-%d%? -- Provide time and date in HH:MM YYYY-MM-DD, which is 16 characters, plus one so that truncation from the
# window list will be truncated with a space between the date and window list
